# find-your-hat_project_codecademy

Going along my **"Let's learn programming!!" path**, 
this is yet another **[codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) Learn Web Development Path [Project](https://www.codecademy.com/practice/projects/find-your-hat)**.

This project consists of a **terminal game**, and it was quite challenging.

In course of solving it, I had to employ **classes**, instantiate and manipulate them.

As an **extra challenge** I had to ressearch and implement a **path finding algorithm**, for instance **[A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)**.

In order to do so, I first went through different path finding algorithms, before choosing A*, and afterwards I was very glad to adapt it to my own situation, 
with the **very welcome help of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKYlikFAV4k&list=WL&index=10&t=0s)**.

Interesting situation, I had to compare two different (but identical) arrys in this program, and of course couldn't use (array === array), 
because of how they're passed (and compared) by reference (I hope I'm right about this). 
The **solution I found in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7837456/how-to-compare-arrays-in-javascript)**, 
was very satisfactory!

I could also count with tha help of my friend, who introduced me to **[jest](https://jestjs.io/en/)**, which I employed in debugging.

And so goes my learning path so far. I'm definetly learning a lot and enjoying every moment (even the "I have no idea what is happenning here!" ones ;))!
